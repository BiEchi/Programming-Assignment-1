Welcome to Computing Assignment 2! We use the same workspace as Computing Assignment 1, but we branch on something else than front-end, Fibonacci Heap, and relevant things. Here are what you need to be careful about.

-   Pull before modifying ANYTHING.
-   ALWAYS wait for front-end unit test to pass, then push.
-   Work on your branch instead of the main branch. Only after your branch is tested WITHOUT ANY BUGS, merge it with the main branch.
-   Note that whenever you want to do ANYTHING to the main branch, make sure that youâ€™ve tried pull.
-   Keep ENERGETIC!
